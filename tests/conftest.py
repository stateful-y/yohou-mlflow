# Hypothesis remembers failing examples so a rerun replays them first. That example
# database defaults to `.hypothesis/` at the repo root; this puts it under
# `.artifacts/` with every other piece of throwaway output. It has no config-file
# key, so registering and loading a profile is the only way to set it -- which is why
# this lives here rather than in pyproject.toml.
#
# This moves the example database ONLY. Hypothesis also writes a `.hypothesis/`
# storage directory for its own constants and unicode caches, which no setting
# relocates. Newer versions drop a self-ignoring `.gitignore` inside it and older
# ones do not, so `.gitignore` lists it explicitly rather than depending on which
# version resolved.
